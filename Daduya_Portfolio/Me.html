            <p>I am Raphael J. Daduya, a Bachelor of Science in Information<br>
            Technology (BSIT) from City College of Calamba. I am <br>
            passionate about technology and how it can be used to solve<br>
            real problems and make everyday tasks easier. Throughout my<br>
            academic journey, I gained experience in system development, <br>
            database management, and user-centered design. I enjoy <br>
            creating solutions that are practical, reliable, and easy to use.<br>
            I am driven, adaptable, and always willing to learn new tools and <br>
            skills to improve my craft. Whether working independently or as<br> 
            part of a team, I make sure to stay focused on the goal and<br>
            deliver quality work. My goal is to continue growing as an IT<br> 
            professional and contribute to meaningful projects in the tech<br>
            industry.</p>
